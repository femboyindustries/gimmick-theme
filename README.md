# gimmick

A minimal NotITG v4.3.0 theme focused on developer simplicity and modern
solutions.

Gimmick is meant to be partly a playground, and partly an example for other
developers aiming to make a theme with no idea where to begin.

## Why is it called "gimmick"?

Because I really don't know if any of what I'm doing is going to stick. The
stuff presented here is highly experimental and prone to breaking under
pressure!
